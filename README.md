This project was inspired by grammarly. The aim of this project is to use artifical inteligence model to create an online editor that can remove errors from text, fix gramatical errors, suggest synonyms and rephrasing sentences.

# Goals for now:
- Make the editor UI
    - add a word and sentence counter
    - allow user to download the work
    - allow user to view synonyms for highlighted words
    - add text sentiment analysis
    - fix spelling errors
    - diff editor (Show the list of changes before applying)
    
- train the model on a data (start with small dataset and then use freely available essays and speeches online)
- apply the model to the text (allow it to make changes to the text)
- optimize the model
- make the model compact so it is less than 40mb

# Libraries:
